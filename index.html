      <p>EN-BOT Adventure is a pixel art, overhead perspective puzzle game highlighting issues in algorithmic technologies with regard to gender and racial bias. It is programmed in Bitsy, a web-based game engine for creating small games using 8-by-8 tiles and a limited color palette; following Oulipoian concepts (Lescure), the game engine is simple, as the constraints allow for greater creativity and flexibility in order to motivate the best possible potential literature, or in this case, video game.</p>
      <p>The primary objective in EN-BOT Adventure is to solve various puzzles and explore different areas in order to collect items scattered around the world as a personal helper robot making decisions informed by artificial intelligence. Around the world there are interactable terminals that give the player additional context of the social injustices the given level touches on.</p>
      <p>As we are using Bitsy, the controls are generally very simple. W,A,S,D or the arrow keys move the player around the room. Walking into an item collects it while walking into a sprite interacts with it in some way.</p>
      <p>	Story and Characters are two of the most important elements of nearly every Bitsy game, and our game is no different. Ideally, each little minigame tells a brief story about some bizarre circumstance that culminates in a social justice realization of some kind or another. In this sense, our game contains a wider story, that of EN-BOT trying to be a good helper, encountering bizarre locales and peculiar circumstances that each carry their own minor narrative for just a few minutes.</p>
